    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <p>Woah, woah</p>
    <p>Yeah</p>
    <p>we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby</p> 
    <p>I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)</p>
    <p>took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby</p> 
    <p>do these  be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?</p>
